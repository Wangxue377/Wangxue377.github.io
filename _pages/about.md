## Overview

I serve as the Director of the Technical Center at Wuhan Zhixing International Engineering Consulting Co., Ltd. My work focuses on the digital transformation of transportation infrastructure, addressing gaps in digital construction and engineering digital twin technologies. With experience in over 60 major national and international projects, I have successfully integrated digital technologies into project management and production, establishing benchmarks for digital applications in the industry.

In the past five years, I have led or participated in more than ten significant research projects, including the "Science and Technology Winter Olympics" program under the National Key Research and Development Plan, which won the Second Prize of the Hubei Provincial Science and Technology Progress Award. Additionally, the research achievements from "Research and Demonstration Application of Digital Complete Technology for Highway Engineering Construction" were recognized as "international leading" by the China Highway Society. Similarly, technological outcomes from projects led by China Communications Construction Company were evaluated as "international leading" by multiple academicians. Academically, I have published over 10 papers, applied for more than 10 national patents, and received accolades including the First Prize of the Longtu Cup and the Second Prize of the Youlu Cup.
